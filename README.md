# GestureTune
A gesture-controlled music player using Python, MediaPipe, OpenCV, and Pygame. Activate gesture mode by pointing at an on-screen circle. Control music with hand gestures like thumbs-up (play) or open palm (stop). Prevents false triggers with a 10-second active window and visual feedback.
